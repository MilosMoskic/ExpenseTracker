# Instructions

Each account has its own transactions, but the categories are the same for all accounts.
Every transaction has category that was recently added. <br />
Transctions can be either "Expenses" or "Income". <br />
When a transaction is created, the amount entered affects the figures displayed on the dashboard.<br />
Total Income, Total Expense and Balance are automatically calculated. <br />
The values displayed on the dashboard tab represent the values for that account.
